## Introduction
A backend REST API that allows users to book, update, retrieve, and delete appointments with doctors.

## Languages and Tools
1. JavaScript
2. Node.JS (Runtime Environment)
3. Express (Node.js web application framework)
4. MySQL
5. Docker
6. PostMan or 'Any other platform' (API Platform for developers to design, build, test and iterate their APIs)


## Planning the API
- In this example, we're using a RESTful API approach with endpoints that correspond to the standard CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete). 
- We're using the "/api/v1" prefix to denote that this is the first version of the API, and we're specifying the resource being accessed (appointments). 
- By using a consistent and well-defined URL structure, we can make it easy for developers to interact with the API and build applications that consume it.
- A router and endpoints defined for a backend REST API used to manage the booking of appointments with doctors. 

###  URL endpoints for a Backend REST API for booking appointments with doctors:

- GET http://localhost:'PORT'/api/v1/appointments – This will retrieve a list of all appointments.

- GET http://localhost:'PORT'/api/v1/appointments/101 – This will retrieve the details of appointment 101.

- POST http://localhost:'PORT'/api/v1/appointments – This will create a new appointment.

- PUT http://localhost:'PORT'/api/v1/appointments/101 – This will update the details of appointment 101.

- DELETE http://localhost:'PORT'/api/v1/appointments/101 – This will delete appointment 101.

###  JSON Structure:
- Each record will contain the following details:

1. an ID of the appointment
2. date and time of appointment
3. patient ID
4. doctor ID
5. appointment type (e.g., physical examination, follow-up, consultation)
